		<h5 class="font-weight-bold my-3">1. About LocalsOne</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					In our experience, the quality of a holiday greatly depends on various factors. The quality of the Tour-guide is an important consideration. Whilst there is a great trove of information on each destination available online, the task of deciding which Tour-guide to choose to avail services from can be a painstaking activity. This website aims to bridge the gap by providing a platform for Travelers and Tour- guides to connect directly. This website also provides a platform for a Tour guide’s past customers to write reviews about their experience such that future Travelers may be able to make more informed decisions on which Tour-guide to choose. The website also makes it possible for potential Travelers to interact with past Travelers to ask specific questions about their experiences.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					On this website, the term “Traveler” predominantly refers to individual travelers and also includes travel agencies and other such organizations that may be planning itineraries or tours for their clients.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					On this website, the term “Tour-guide” broadly refers to all people who may provide to a Traveler services such as, but not limited to, taking a Traveler through an historical monument, on a scuba diving session, on a sky dive, a hot air balloon ride, on a fishing boat or even on a simple hike, as well as the travel companies who may organize activities, whether on a customized or standardized basis, for Travelers at a particular destination.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The User profiles shared on this website are not verified by LocalsOne, and we strongly urge potential Travelers to exercise due caution while dealing with people who may claim to be Tour-guides, and vice versa, on this website.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					As per our booking terms, a traveler pays either an initial deposit or the entire tour price upfront to confirm the tour. Upon payment of this fee, the booking of a tour is confirmed. If only a partial deposit is paid, then the remainder is to be paid to the Tour-guide directly on meeting. We cannot be held liable for any loss or damage suffered by any Traveler who may rely on information available on this website. We are also not liable to Tour-guides in the event that the Traveler does not pay the outstanding amount to the Tour-guide.
